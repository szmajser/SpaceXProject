# Module 1 Capstone Project 
## ðŸš€ SpaceX Launch Analysis

## Project Description 
This project analyzes SpaceX launch data to identify trends and patterns regarding the reuse of rocket, success rates, and launch efficiencies. 

## Data Source
SpaceX API Docs - https://docs.spacexdata.com/
API Data used: 
- https://docs.spacexdata.com/#5fc4c846-c373-43df-a10a-e9faf80a8b0a - (API Docs - Launches)
- https://api.spacexdata.com/v3/launches - (API Endpoint - Launches)

## Analysis
The relationship between reusability and launch success.
How specific rocket models and launch sites performed in terms of success rates.
Patterns in launch behavior over the years.

### Key questions:
- How successful are reused rockets and fairings compared to new ones?
- which is the launch success rate of each rocket type?
- Which launch locations have the highest success rates?
